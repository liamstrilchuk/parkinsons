			<h1 class="centered">About</h1>
			<p>Parkinson's disease is a disease that affects the <i>substantia nigra</i>, the part of the brain that controls movement. In particular, it affects cells that produce <i>dopamine</i>. The lack of dopamine prevents the brain from controlling movement efficiently.</p>
			<p>Parkinson's is a chronic condition, meaning that it lasts for a long period of time and the symptoms get worse over time. Some people affected by Parkinson's are only minorly affected, but some eventually become severely disabled.</p>

			<h1 class="centered">Symptoms and diagnosis</h1>
			<p>There is no specific medical technology that can diagnose Parkinson's disease. Instead, it is diagnosed by a neurologist, who assesses the symptoms a person is experiencing and their personal and family medical history to tell if they are at risk for the disease. Some of the symptoms include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tremor or shaking in hands, arms, jaw, or head</li>
				<li>Stiffness of the limbs or trunk</li>
				<li>Slowness of movement</li>
				<li>Impaired balance or coordination</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centered">Treatment and research</h1>
			<p>There is currently no way to treat Parkinson's disease, but there are ways to reduce the symptoms. A type of surgery is available for some people called "deep brain stimulation", which uses small amounts of electricity to stimulate the part of the brain that produces dopamine. Therapy is also available, including both physiotherapy and speech therapy. Some medication can reduce the symptoms, including <i>levadopa</i>, which is absorbed by nerve cells and turned into dopamine, and <i>inhibitors</i>, which blocks the part of the brain that breaks down dopamine.</p>
			<p>Lots of medical organisations, like Johns Hopkins and the National Institute of Health, are funding projects and developing new medications and technologies to help combat the effects of Parkinson's disease.</p>

			<h1 class="centered">Where does Parkinson's occur?</h1>
			<p>Parkinson's disease occurs in every country in the world, though it kills significantly more people in less developed countries. The countries with the highest death rate from the disease are Qatar, Fiji, and Tajikistan. Canada is relatively unaffected by this issue, with only 3.46 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 4.55 in the United States, 4.84 in Finland, and 4.31 in the United Kingdom.</p>
			<p>Parkinson's was first diagnosed in 1817 by James Parkinson, and the disease's description was expanded in the mid-19th century by Jean-Martin Charcot, who analyzed information from around the world.</p>
